## 👋 Hello! I’m Hariohm Bhatt
I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at Ahmedabad University, driven by a passion for applying AI and computer vision to healthcare. With hands-on experience in deep learning, real-time image enhancement, and full-stack app development, I thrive on building innovative solutions that make a tangible impact. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems—especially those that improve surgical safety and diagnostic accuracy.

## 🎯 Objective

I am passionate about exploring how computer science shapes society and drives innovation. Inspired by the diverse ideas I encounter every day, I aim to deepen my understanding and make meaningful contributions in areas that spark my curiosity:

- **Computer Vision**: Crafting algorithms that help machines interpret and analyze visual data—whether it’s medical imaging for life‐saving interventions or autonomous systems navigating real-world environments.  
- **Image Processing**: Enhancing and transforming images to extract valuable insights, improve diagnostic accuracy, or elevate visual quality across various domains.  
- **Economics**: Applying computational methods to model economic phenomena, optimize resource allocation, and inform data‐driven policy decisions.  
- **Art**: Bridging technology and creativity by using AI to generate, augment, or curate artistic expressions that inspire and engage.  
- **Quantitative Finance Algorithms**: Designing and implementing data‐driven strategies for financial markets, risk management, and algorithmic trading.

Moving forward, I’m excited to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that push boundaries, drive positive societal impact, and encourage lifelong learning in these ever‐evolving fields. 🚀
